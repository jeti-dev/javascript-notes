| Modules           | Organize application structure into cohesive blocks.                        |
| Controllers       | Handle incoming requests and return responses.                              |
| Providers         | Services or classes that can be injected as dependencies.                   |
| Dependency Injection | NestJS's built-in DI system for managing class dependencies.             |
| Services          | Classes with business logic, injected into controllers.                     |
| Routing           | Define paths for controllers using decorators like `@Get()` or `@Post()`.   |
| CLI               | The Nest CLI helps generate and manage project files.                       |
| Lifecycle Hooks   | Hooks like `OnInit` and `OnDestroy` for handling component lifecycle.       |
| DTOs              | Define shapes of incoming data using TypeScript classes.                    |
| Pipes             | Transform and validate input data.                                          |

| Middleware        | Functions that run before request reaches the controller.                   |
| Guards            | Used for authorization and route protection.                               |
| Interceptors      | Logic that can run before/after request handling (e.g., logging, caching).  |
| Exception Filters | Handle and customize errors thrown during request processing.               |
| Custom Decorators | Create reusable decorators for parameters or class logic.                   |
| Async Providers   | Define providers that need to be created asynchronously.                    |
| Request Lifecycle | Understanding how Nest handles a request from start to finish.              |
| ConfigModule      | Load and manage environment variables/config settings.                      |
| Global Modules    | Modules made available app-wide without importing in each module.           |
| Param Decorators  | Extract specific parameters from routes, like `@Param`, `@Query`.           |
